metabolic_rate_functions.R --contains functions for processing metabolic rate data, from a FireStingO2 oxygen meter
metabolic_rate_eg.R --contains an example script for using these functions to process raw data (this code won't actually run because I haven't provided any data. It's just to show the workflow).
